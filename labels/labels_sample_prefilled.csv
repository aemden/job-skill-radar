0ea10ca40a2ffae5,Actuarial Data Scientist,"Remote in New York, NY","About Ledger Investing Ledger Investing is a Y Combinator backed insure-tech startup that is transforming the way insurance risks are financed. Today, Ledger is an online marketplace connecting insurance risk to capital, focusing on securitization. Insurance risk originators are able to source capital more efficiently vs. the traditional value-chain. Capital providers gain access to an asset class that is highly diversified vs. most asset classes. Insurance securitization has quickly grown to be a $100 billion market but is limited in scope due to opacity and complexity. Ledger is expanding this market to $1 trillion by building a seamless data pipeline from the policyholder to the capital markets, enabling transparency, and bringing best-in-class analytics and real-time insights to the table. Our recent $75 million Series B round of investment funding has set us up for exponential growth. We are on our way to disrupting the industry by serving as an unparalleled, advantageous marketplace for virtually all types of insurance risks and capital, including traditional reinsurers, institutional investors, and accredited investors. About the Team: Data scientists at Ledger are critical to the success of the company. Our team specializes in modeling the behavior of casualty insurance risk portfolios. We analyze and predict the performance of every insurance program that seeks capital through us, and our analyses are critical in determining on what terms, if any, our investors are willing to offer capital for each program. In short, our math forms the ground truth that serves as the basis of negotiations for transactions with tens of millions of dollars at stake. About the Position: The questions we focus on have broad overlap with traditional topics within actuarial science: estimating loss development, forecasting portfolio performance, quantifying tail risk, and the like. Instead of using traditional actuarial methods, we rely instead on more modern statistical approaches, particularly from the fields of Bayesian statistics and machine learning. We are building a robust, scalable, and highly automated pipeline by which we can price ILS transactions at scale with minimal human intervention. At the same time, we recognize the value in more traditional actuarial perspectives, as they are the fruit of decades of practical experience. We also still regularly deal with stakeholders who are immersed in a traditional perspective, and actuaries play a vital role in translating to and from the modern Bayesian approaches we use internally. The synthesis of actuarial domain knowledge with cutting-edge techniques is at the crux of what we do. About You: Successful candidates will have all of the following attributes: Extensive knowledge of statistics, machine learning, and data science. Several years of hands-on experience in pricing and/or reserving for property and/or casualty insurance lines. Demonstrated ability to apply new statistical or modeling techniques to actuarial problems (e.g., loss development, rate segmentation, trend estimation, etc) Familiarity with modern Bayesian modeling techniques. Extensive experience with Python, R, Julia or other open-source languages with strong numerical computing ecosystems Strong attention to detail and ability to reconcile conflicting or ambiguous sources of information. Ability to work independently and communicate ideas effectively. The following attributes will help candidates stand out from the crowd: A track record of publications and/or presentations on actuarial modeling topics. Contributions to open-source data science or machine learning projects. An actuarial designation (ie., ACAS or FCAS). MS or PhD in statistics or a related field preferred. Familiarity with Bayesian modeling using Stan. Familiarity with version control, especially Git/GitHub. Your Benefits: Competitive salary, bonus potential, and equity compensation Work from anywhere.

b6d64b41dcf7b8f1,Data Scientist,"Remote in Seattle, WA","About PerfectRec PerfectRec is a machine-learning powered decision engine focused on helping people find good, personalized recommendations without exhaustive research. We are starting with electronics, then other products such as cars and clothing, but ultimately we'll expand into other, more complicated decisions such as where to live or work. (Since you're reading this, our non-ML based recommendation is that you really consider working here.) We are starting with smartphones, laptops and other consumer electronics since there is an immediate and growing need for reliable recommendations for these products. Spammy search results, fake reviews, and paid affiliate sites make it nearly impossible to get an honest and relevant product recommendation. Finding the right item to meet your unique needs is tricky. And making the wrong choice based on bad information is a frustrating waste of time and money. We hope to attract billions of users, collectively save them billions and billions of hours on their product searches, and provide a similar amount of value by guiding our users to the right products for themselves. We're solving the problem by combining actual human subject-area experts with machine learning to help everyone — regardless of their expertise — find their perfect product, quickly. To do that, we guide users through a series of questions about what they're looking for. After each answer, we share updated recommendations and encourage answering more questions to further improve our recommendations. Ultimately, we will get more information about a user's specific needs from a few quick multiple-choice questions than Amazon or Google can deduce from a search query and their past browsing data. This will enable us to make better recommendations tailored to each user's unique needs. A Small Team Where You Can Have A Big Impact PerfectRec is a small, early-stage startup where you can have a big impact. Our founding team has experience building successful startups and working at big organizations, like Google, Amazon, Twitch and UC Berkeley. We are growing fast, and looking for people who are excited to build a new product where they can have a big impact. Founder Led, Founder Funded Our CEO Joe Golden bootstrapped his first startup, Collage.com, to ~$100m in revenue and a successful exit in March 2021. He's using some of the proceeds from that sale to launch PerfectRec and give us a long runway of at least 3 years to build a great team and outstanding decision-engine. Working At PerfectRec We are an all-remote company, so we don't care where you live as long as you work well in a fast-paced, collaborative remote environment. PerfectRec is an Equal Opportunity Employer. We are committed to finding the best candidates for every role and giving them the tools and guidance they need to succeed. Our all-remote structure enables us to recruit anywhere in the world, so our talent pool isn't limited to a few big cities, and our asynchronous structure allows our team to work when it's best for them. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees. Learn more about how we work and our differentiating values. What You'll Bring Strong sense of ownership. Ownership is taking responsibility for the outcomes of a task or project. You'll relish these ownership opportunities and ensure that tasks, projects, or the team are making positive forward progress. Clear and concise communication. Building software is a team sport that relies heavily on great communication. You'll be responsible for clear, thoughtful, and concise written and verbal communication. This includes the ability to give and receive feedback with empathy and understanding whether in a code review or a 1:1. Willingness to teach and learn. We're always evolving with new tools and practices. You'll be willing to jump in and learn unfamiliar technologies while also bringing others along with you. Mentorship and helping others learn are important parts of achieving this. Creative problem solving. Creating a decision engine that can make recommendations across wide ranging domains is hard, and the potential data sources are limitless. You'll be able to evaluate and explore existing sets of data, suggest new sources of data, and be able to build models that learn from this data in novel ways. Balance of perfection and pragmatism. Software has a lot of trade-offs and ways to solve problems. You'll be able to recognize and balance the trade-offs between long-term system health and bringing value to customers faster. Your tooling choices will reflect ability to solve the problem the best way and not just the latest and greatest. What You'll Do Create and explore datasets for powering recommendations, working closely with domain experts. Prototype models for making recommendations in new domains. Identify ways to evaluate and compare competing models. Add new capabilities that are shared between models in different categories. Solve technical problems across the stack and contribute to all parts of our code base, including creation of our internal machine learning library. Share your expertise and experience to grow with the team. Collaborate with product, design, and engineers to understand customer needs, design solutions, and prototype, launch, and iterate. Build a product that is genuinely loved by users and respects their time. Relevant Experience We believe that everybody has the ability to learn and grow. So, relevant doesn't mean required or that you need everything on the list (this isn't a Pokédex). If you've used other tools, languages, and frameworks that are similar to what is listed, please apply! We only list specific tools so that you know the tech stack you're walking into. Python or R. Exploratory data analysis and data visualization. Classical machine learning techniques like classification, regression, regularization, and cross-validation. sklearn, Keras (or other deep learning frameworks like Tensorflow and PyTorch). Recommender systems, including learning-to-rank. SQL. Technical writing. Salary & Benefits We believe in offering generous compensation and benefits tailored to our all-remote workplace. We pay well because we want to work with highly motivated people that will help make the company successful. Pay Range and Level of Role $130,000 - $300,000 salary and stock options which vest over 4 years. We are hiring data scientists with different levels of experience. Compensation is based on background and experience. Benefits 100% remote and no cost-of-living pay cuts. We want you to work where you work best and we are not going to ""adjust"" your pay if you move somewhere with a lower cost of living. We pay 100% of your and your dependents' healthcare premium in a high-quality, national PPO plan for US-based employees. For international employees, we will work with you if you're not covered by your national health plan. We will buy the office equipment you need to succeed. Lots of companies are miserly about equipment. We are not going to do that because your time is valuable. 401k with generous matching. Once we have 20 employees, we'll set up a 401k program with generous matching. Generous PTO. We trust everyone to take time off appropriately for themselves. We're pro-regular vacations - not taking regular breaks isn't good for individuals or the team. Once we have 20 employees, we will establish a more formal PTO policy. Worry-free sick days. If you're sick, take the time off to get well. Just let your manager know as soon as practicable. Free products that we're reviewing. We are becoming product experts together, and we will send you cool stuff like monitors and TVs as we add new recommendation lines.

aacd8b0ae61eda2f,Machine Learning Engineer,"Remote in New York, NY","About Ledger Investing Ledger Investing is a Y Combinator backed insure-tech startup that is transforming the way insurance risks are financed. Today, Ledger is an online marketplace connecting insurance risk to capital, focusing on securitization. Insurance risk originators are able to source capital more efficiently vs. the traditional value-chain. Capital providers gain access to an asset class that is highly diversified vs. most asset classes. Insurance securitization has quickly grown to be a $100 billion market but is limited in scope due to opacity and complexity. Ledger is expanding this market to $1 trillion by building a seamless data pipeline from the policyholder to the capital markets, enabling transparency, and bringing best-in-class analytics and real-time insights to the table. Our recent $75 million Series B round of investment funding has set us up for exponential growth. We are on our way to disrupting the industry by serving as an unparalleled, advantageous marketplace for virtually all types of insurance risks and capital, including traditional reinsurers, institutional investors, and accredited investors. About the Team: Data scientists at Ledger are critical to the success of the company. Our team specializes in modeling the behavior of casualty insurance risk portfolios. We analyze and predict the performance of every insurance program that seeks capital through us, and our analyses are critical in determining on what terms, if any, our investors are willing to offer capital for each program. In short, our math forms the ground truth that serves as the basis of negotiations for transactions with tens of millions of dollars at stake. About the Position: As our company continues to grow, we are focused on opportunities to use technology to scale efficiently. From a data science perspective, one such core opportunity is providing a seamless infrastructure layer that allows everyone in the organization to easily train, backtest, and deploy statistical models. We heavily rely on Stan for our modeling, which has not gotten as much attention as some other tools in the data science and machine learning communities for this sort of infrastructure. A complete analytical process for a single insurance program may consist of a half a dozen or more independent statistical models. The identity, configuration and method of combination of these models varies considerably from program to program, and we are responsible for providing daily or weekly performance updates on dozens of these programs. Striking the right balance between flexibility and consistency for deploying these analytical processes to production is another key problem. If these problems sound fun and interesting, we'd love to have you on our team. About You: Successful candidates will have all of the following attributes: Strong knowledge of statistics, machine learning, and data science. Extensive experience with Python and its associated ecosystem for machine learning (e.g., NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Jupyter, etc). Extensive experience with virtualization, cloud environments, cluster computing, and other techniques for efficiently deploying models for large-scale production use. Experience with relational databases and strong ability to write queries in SQL. Familiarity with version control, especially Git/GitHub. Ability to work independently and communicate ideas effectively. The following attributes will help you stand out from the crowd: A track record of building or contributing to open-source projects. Working knowledge of property & casualty insurance, particularly from an actuarial and/or underwriting perspective. Experience with Stan or another open-source tool for estimating Bayesian models via HMC. Your Benefits: Competitive salary, bonus potential, and equity compensation Work from anywhere. We're flexible. Our headquarters is in New York, but this position can be fully remote or hybrid. Uncapped paid time off Paid Holidays 401k Medical, dental, and vision insurance - multiple plans to choose from Company paid Life and AD&D insurance ClassPass - We contribute to your monthly membership offering a large range of providers & services in Fitness and Wellness.

Building this better internet might seem daunting or even unthinkable, but at Proton, this is what we do every day. Proton was founded in 2014 by a group of scientists who met at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). Our first product, Proton Mail, is now the world’s largest encrypted email service. Subsequent Proton products, such as Proton VPN, Proton Calendar, and Proton Drive, give our users full control over how and with whom their data is shared. Today, Proton makes privacy universally accessible. Journalists from outlets like The Guardian and The New York Times, some of the world’s largest organizations, and people in more than 180 countries have signed up for over 70 million accounts. Our diverse and dynamic team is made up of more than 400 members representing over 40 different nationalities. While we are based in Geneva, Switzerland, we have offices in Zurich, Prague, London, Vilnius, Skopje, Taipei, and many more employees working remotely around the world. Join one of Europe’s fastest-growing companies to help us solve challenging problems and build new products that will reach hundreds of millions of people. We want to create more than just one of the world’s most impactful tech companies; we want to create a new internet that serves the interests of all people. We need you, your voice, your ideas, and your ambition to make it happen. Purpose of the role The MSA department is a highly multi-disciplinary group started in 2019 to tackle difficult mail delivery, spam and abuse problems. We built sophisticated systems from scratch that combine human intelligence and machine learning to make tens of millions of realtime or asynchronous decisions each day. As of 2022, our three areas of focus are 1) mail delivery and spam, 2) abuse and account security, and 3) site reliability of Proton. Over the past 3 years, our custom systems have reduced spam filter misclassifications by over 50%, blocked millions of abusive bulk signups, protected hundreds of thousands of users from account compromise by attackers, and mitigated hundreds of DDoS attacks. In order to move fast with limited resources, we are organized into autonomous teams responsible for the whole system, with expertise across infrastructure, data storage, backend, frontend, machine learning, security and operational excellence. In 3 years, we grew from 2 engineers to over 30 engineers and analysts, spread across 3 continents for 24/7 coverage. We are looking for humble, mission-driven, systems-thinking people who want to make a big impact in a startup environment. What you will do MSA uses machine learning in areas where it can significantly improve on manually created rules. We have successfully applied clustering to abuse detection, supervised learning to spam filtering, and anomaly detection to many domains. In order to meet the demands of scale, we approach machine learning challenges from a systems engineering standpoint, pushing the boundaries of scalable computing, and tying together numerous data sources to build models that protect our users and reputation. You will work with analysts and engineers to solve difficult problems and reduce human toil across many domains. As an engineering-driven organization, MSA currently doesn't have product or project managers, so you will have the opportunity to play those roles and lead the whole planning and development process. You will be responsible for the performance and reliability of the machine learning systems.
